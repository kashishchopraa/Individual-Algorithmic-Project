5.3-5.4 Notes:

5.3 Computing Bias

Bias exists in different computing innovations
Computing innovations reflect human biases that already exist because of biases written into the algorithms or in the data used by the innovation
Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations to combat existing human biases
Biases can be used at all levels of software development

5.4 Crowdsourcing: Exploring the advantages of a computer’s reach

People participate in problem-solving processes at scale
Widespread access to information and public data allows the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results
Science has been affected by using “citizen science” to solve problems
Citizen science is scientific research conducted by distributed individuals, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices
Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the internet
Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing
Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding

5.3 Computing Bias
1) I think that the owner did not think this was intentional
2) He did not think it was intentional
3) I believe this happened because of the lack of testing among different races 
4) Yes I think this is harmful
5) To fix this, development teams should make sure they have more duverse teams to ensure everyone has a say and is not biased towards because of their race or ethnicity

5.4 Crowdsourcing: Exploring the advantages of a computer’s reach
1) A Crowdsource idea is asking a question through a poll on the slack channel because all of the CS students use that platform
2) For Del Norte crowdsourcing you could use a google form and send it our via canvas for all students to respond to

Week 0 

5.1-5.2 Notes:

5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects: Effects of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful

People can create computing innovations
The way people finish tasks usually changes to include new computing innovations
Not every effect of a computing innovation can be predicted in advance
A signal effect can be seen either as beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person
Advances in computing have increased creativity in fields such as medicine and engineering  
Computing innovations can have an long lasting impact 
Computing innovation can be used in ways that they were not originally intended 
Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a negative impact on society


5.2 Digital Divide: Specific issues contribute to the digital divide Essential Knowledge

Internet access changes between characteristics such as socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic 
The digital divide can reverse differing access to computing devices and the internet depending on characteristics listed above
The digital divide affects both groups and individuals
It raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals and groups

5.1:
1) Some benefits of computing is that the internet allows for faster spread of information. However, this can also lead to misinformation and the spread of things that are not actually true. Another benefit is video games that can be used to play with people all over the world and can help people connect. However, this can lead to cyberbullying and expose children to dangerous people. Lastly, social media helps to connect with lots of people but accoutns can get hacked and become dangerous. 
2) Dopamine directly relates to the pleasure we feel in the brain by neurotransmitters. I do think it is real because it distracts me from doing homework sometimes. FOr example, if I start watching a Netflix show, I want to keep watching because it keeps me engaged and happy and I end up watching multiple episodes instead of doing my work

5.2:
1) Someone could empower themselves in the digital world by being more familiar with technology and how they function
2) Someone that is empowered can help those who are not by sharing their knowledge and providing them with resources if possible. At Del Norte, I could help people who are not as familiar with computers and help them be more comfortable with them
3) Yes it is blocking digital empowerment because it restricts us from doing certain things. At Del Nirte the wifi restricts us from certain sites which prevents us from seeing our own websites in Computer Science

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kashishchopraa/Individual-Algorithmic-Project/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kashishchopraa/Individual-Algorithmic-Project/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
