5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects: Effects of a computing innovation can be both beneficial and harmful

People can create computing innovations
The way people finish tasks usually changes to include new computing innovations
Not every effect of a computing innovation can be predicted in advance
A signal effect can be seen either as beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person
Advances in computing have increased creativity in fields such as medicine and engineering  
Computing innovations can have an long lasting impact 
Computing innovation can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended (ex: world wide web, targeted advertising, machine learning and data mining)
Some of the ways computing innovations can be sued may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture





You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kashishchopraa/Individual-Algorithmic-Project/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kashishchopraa/Individual-Algorithmic-Project/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
